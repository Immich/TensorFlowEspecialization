# WEEK 2 QUIZ :computer:

#### 1. What is a windowed dataset?
R = A fixed-sized subset of a time series

#### 2. What does `drop_remainder = true` do?
R = It ensures that all rows in the data window are the same lenght by cropping data

#### 3. Whatâ€™s the correct line of code to split an n column window into n-1 columns for features and 1 column for a label
R = `dataset = dataset.map(lambda window: (window[:-1], window[-1:]))`

#### 4. What does MSE stand for?
R = Mean Squared Error

#### 5. What does MAE stand for?
R = Mean Absolute Error

#### 6. If time values are in time[], series values are in series[] and we want to split the series into training and validation at time 1000, what is the correct code?
R =
```python
time_train = time[:split_time]
x_train = series[:split_time]
time_valid = time[split_time:]
x_valid = series[split_time:]
```

#### 7. If you want to inspect the learned parameters in a layer after training, what's a good technique to use?
R = Assign a variable to the layer and add it to the model using that variable. Inspects its properties after training.

#### 8. How do you set the learning rate of the SGD optimizer? 
R = Use the lr propertie

#### 9. If you want to amend the learning rate of the optimizer on the fly, after each epoch, what do you do?
R = Use a LearningRateScheduler object in the callbacks namespace and assign that to the callback
