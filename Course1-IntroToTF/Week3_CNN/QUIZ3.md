# WEEK 3 QUIZ

#### 1. What is a Convolution?
R = A technique to isolate features in images

#### 2. What is a Pooling?
R = A technique to reduce information in an image while maintaining features

#### 3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
R = They isolate features in images

#### 4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
R = 26x26

#### 5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
R = 13x13

#### 6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
R = It depends on many factors. IT might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
