# TensorFlowEspecialization

This repo is a compendium of the projects and notes I did in order to achieve the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice).

Courses:

* [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow)
* [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)
* [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow]("https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow")
* [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)


Some of the topics covered in these courses are:

* Best practices for using TensorFlow
* Strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout
* Text processsing, including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors
* RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow
